# The Plan

## What do you think your goal is?

A data analyst must:

- Understand pollution
- Finding causes of pollution

## We aim to help them by:

- Making a dashboard that enables data analysts to gain the above insights

## Understanding of the points above What are the major steps?

- Understand the data
- Upload to an S3 bucket
- Upload to Talend from the S3 bucket
- Clean the data â€“ use Talend
- Upload it to Amazon via Talend
- Learn about QuickSight
- Create a dashboard on Quicksight

## List the pitfalls

- Quicksight might not work on a student account
- Cleaning data may have roadblocks
- Talend licencing issues

## What's in scope for version one

- On version 1 we can build the system without cleaning data
- All data fields displayed

## What questions need to be considered

- The question will always be a when (the data is with time parameters)
- Rate of change

## What is the tech-stack, draw out diagram of data flow

- Amazon RDS
- Amazon S3
- Amazon Quicksight (Tableau as a backup)
- Talend (KNIME as a backup)
